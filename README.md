This code is not of my own, as I am simply following along with "http://www.craftinginterpreters.com/contents.html". 
The code written here is an archive of my learning pursuits. My goal is not only to copy, but understand and expand apon the source material. 
That expansion will definitely be done in a new project after this, and I'm unsure how much I will expand this once I've gone through it.
